# XO Object Gateway
XO object gateway implements a simple object gateway for a Ceph cluster. XO server is executed on every OSD host and on a dedicated frontend server. The frontend server acts like a normal object gateway when migration is not used. When migration is used, it offloads TCP connections to OSD hosts that is serving the requested object, rather than performing a remote object fetch through RADOS.
## Building
### Dependencies
XO gateway needs the following dependencies. Install their development files.
- LibXml2
- librados2
- uriparser
- OpenSSL
- PkgConfig
- inih
- libprotobuf-c
- proto-c
- libforward-tc (automatically fetched)
- llhttp (automatically fetched)
- CMake
- libzlog
- libmnl-dev
- elfutils
- libelf-dev
- libbpf
- bison
- flex
- clang
- llvm
- gcc-multilib
- libz
### Ceph
Ceph should be built with the following patch when building Ceph to enable a special getter function in `librados` for retrieving object location: https://patch-diff.githubusercontent.com/raw/ceph/ceph/pull/60607.patch
### Configuration
Clone the repository and configure with CMake.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/uoenoplab/xo-server
$ cd xo-server
$ mkdir build
$ cmake -DUSE_MIGRATION=ON ..
$ make -j `nproc`
```
The option `-DUSE_MIGRATION=ON` enables XO. Otherwise, it is built as a normal object gateway similar to Ceph RGW. The build script automatically fetches `libforward-tc` and dependencies and builds it.
## Running
### NIC Configuration
Edit the `IFNAME` (replace `ens1f0np0`) in `ebpf_redirect_block_load.sh` that is generated in the build folder with the network interface. The script sets up the qdiscs and eBPF program that is used as a classifier. Run the script as follows.
```bash ebpf_redirect_block_load.sh
# ./ebpf_redirect_block_load.sh 
+ IFNAME=ens1f0np0
+ '[' 0 -eq 2 ']'
+ NAME=ebpf_redirect_block
+ BPFPATH=/sys/fs/bpf/ebpf_redirect_block
+ BPFPROG=../build/ebpf_redirect_block.o
+ tc qdisc del dev ens1f0np0 clsact
Error: Cannot find specified qdisc on specified device.
+ rm -rf /sys/fs/bpf/ebpf_redirect_block
+ mkdir /sys/fs/bpf/ebpf_redirect_block
+ bpftool prog load ../build/ebpf_redirect_block.o /sys/fs/bpf/ebpf_redirect_block/main pinmaps /sys/fs/bpf/ebpf_redirect_block

#
```
### Configuration Files
XO uses `ceph.conf` to read the address and OSD ID information to determine backend servers. Ensure it is placed in `/etc/ceph/ceph.conf` and provides all the OSD information. For example:
```ini
[osd.0]
host = n08
public_addr = 192.168.11.80
cluster_addr = 192.168.11.80

[osd.1]
host = n09
public_addr = 192.168.11.110
cluster_addr = 192.168.11.110

[osd.2]
host = n11
public_addr = 192.168.11.70
cluster_addr = 192.168.11.70

[osd.3]
host = n12
public_addr = 192.168.11.100
cluster_addr = 192.168.11.100
```
Place `zlog.conf` in `/etc/zlog.conf` for message logging.
### Running XO server
Run the server using the `server.out` binary. It takes the following options:
```bash
Usage: ./server.out [interface] [threads] [enable migration (0/1)] [use TC] [TC offload] [use hybrid if TC offload = 1]
```
- interface: The name of the NIC interface to use
- threads: Number of server threads to use
- enable migration: 1 to enable migration
- use TC: if migration is used, 1 to use TC for packet forwarding, otherwise 0 to use eBPF
- TC Offload: if using TC, 1 to enable tc hardware offload
- use hybrid: 1 to use hybrid eBPF/hw-tc

Run XO server on every OSD host, and finally, a dedicated (non-OSD) frontend host. For example:
```bash
# ./server.out ens1f0np0 32 1 1 1 1
03-29 21:58:59 INFO  [main]    [2f7d5980] [server.c:886] [main] RADO Async Write: disabled

```
The frontend host is used for accepting client HTTP/HTTPS connections.
